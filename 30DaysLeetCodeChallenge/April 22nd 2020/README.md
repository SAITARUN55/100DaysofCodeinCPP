Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

#### Example 1:
#### Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
#### Output: 2
#### Note:
The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].

#### Show Hint #1
Will Brute force work here? Try to optimize it.

#### Show Hint #2
Can we optimize it by using some extra space?

#### Show Hint #3
What about storing sum frequencies in a hash table? Will it be useful?

#### Show Hint #4
sum(i,j)=sum(0,j)-sum(0,i), where sum(i,j) represents the sum of all the elements from index i to j-1. Can we use this property to optimize it.
