Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

#### Example:

#### Input: 38
#### Output: 2 
#### Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
             Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
#### Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

#### Show Hint #1
A naive implementation of the above process is trivial. Could you come up with other methods?

#### Show Hint #2
What are all the possible results?

#### Show Hint #3
How do they occur, periodically or randomly?

#### Show Hint #4
